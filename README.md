### Hi there 👋

I'm a Tech Lead with a passion for running effective, collaborative and fun teams that look to deliver value in every pull request we open 💪

Currently helping high-growth, fast-paced startup Shift disrupt the logistics industry by building a tech powered digital marketplace 🚀

While not coordinating dev teams, I enjoy getting back behind the keyboard as a Senior/Lead Engineer 👨‍💻

I've primarily worked on complex React.js front-end web applications with Node.js or PHP laravel backends, but have a soft spot for Go, Rust and the right tool for the job ⚛️

Value stream management and dev team operational efficiency concepts and practices are things that I enjoy discussing and sharing with dev teams 🤓

Away from the code base I enjoy walking my dogs around beautiful Dartmoor National Park, that I call home, stroking my cats, riding horses and playing cricket 🏔️

For more information, about the tech stack and collection of tools that I am familiar with, please see the Projects and Skills section on this page 🔧

Feel free to reach out to me at ben@benpaynehunt.co.uk or via DM ✉️

I look forward to hearing from you
